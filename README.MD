# Meta Database Engineer Capstone Project

A database management project aimed at setting up and optimizing the database environment for Little Lemon, a fast-food restaurant. The project is a part of the [Meta Database Engineer Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-database-engineer) course on Coursera and it spans from database setup to data visualization using MySQL and Tableau, along with creating a database client in Python

## Project Overview

Key components and steps involved in this project include:

1. MySQL instance configuration and ER diagram design
2. SQL query development
3. Data visualization with tableau and python-based database client

## Project Modules

<h3> 1. MySQL instance configuration and ER diagram design </h3>

- Set up a MySQL instance server using MySQL Workbench.
- Create and implement an ER diagram data model, conforming to the three fundamental forms.

- [Mock data insert script](https://github.com/marianamannes/db-capstone-project/blob/master/insert/insert_MockData.sql)

<h3> 2. SQL query development </h3>

- Create queries to sales report and booking system.

  <details>
  <summary> Queries to sales report </summary>
  
    <details>
    <summary>Create a view with all orders with a quantity greater than 2</summary>

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW OrdersView AS
      (SELECT id AS order_id,
                    quantity,
                    total_cost
      FROM orders
      WHERE quantity > 2);
    ```
      
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Create a query to return all customers with orders that cost more than $150</summary>

    ```sql
    SELECT c.id AS customer_id,
          c.name as customer_name,
          o.id AS order_id,
          o.total_cost,
          m.name AS menu_name,
          mi.course_name,
          mi.starter_name
    FROM orders o 
    LEFT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
    LEFT JOIN menu m ON o.menu_id = m.id
    LEFT JOIN menu_items mi ON m.menu_item_id = mi.id
    WHERE total_cost > 150
    ORDER BY total_cost;
    ```
      
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary>Find all menu items for which more than 2 orders have been placed</summary>

    ```sql
    SELECT m.id AS menu_id,
          c.name AS cuisine_name,
          m.name AS menu_name
    FROM menu m 
    LEFT JOIN cuisines c ON m.cuisine_id = c.id

      ```
