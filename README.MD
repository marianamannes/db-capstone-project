# Meta Database Engineer Capstone Project

A database management project aimed at setting up and optimizing the database environment for Little Lemon, a fast-food restaurant. The project is a part of the [Meta Database Engineer Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-database-engineer) course on Coursera and it spans from database setup to data visualization using MySQL and Tableau, along with creating a database client in Python

## Project Overview

- **Module One**: Setting up a repository, MySQL instance server and an ER diagram data model.
- **Module Two**: Creating virtual tables with JOINs, optimized queries, and managing bookings using SQL.
- **Module Three**: Creating interactive dashboards in Tableau and developing a Python-based database client.

## Project Modules

<h3> 1. Database Environment Setup </h3>

- Set up a MySQL instance server using MySQL Workbench.
- Create and implement an ER diagram data model, conforming to the three fundamental forms, including the following tables:
	- Bookings: To store information about booked tables in the restaurant including booking id, date and table number.
	- Orders: To store information about each order such as order date, quantity and total cost.
	- Order delivery status: To store information about the delivery status of each order such as delivery date and status.
	- Menu: To store information about cuisines, starters, courses, drinks and desserts.
	- Customer details: To store information about the customer names and contact details.
	- Staff information: Including role and salary.

<h3> 2. Sales Reports and Table Booking System </h3>

- Some simple tasks to test the database:

  <details>
  <summary>Create a view with all orders with a quantity greater than 2</summary>
    
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW OrdersView AS
  	(SELECT id AS order_id,
                  quantity,
                  total_cost
  	FROM orders
  	WHERE quantity > 2);
  ```
  
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Create a query to return all customers with orders that cost more than $150</summary>
  
  ```sql
  SELECT c.id AS customer_id,
         c.name as customer_name,
         o.id AS order_id,
         o.total_cost,
         m.name AS menu_name,
         mi.course_name,
         mi.starter_name
  FROM orders o 
  LEFT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
  LEFT JOIN menu m ON o.menu_id = m.id
  LEFT JOIN menu_items mi ON m.menu_item_id = mi.id
  WHERE total_cost > 150
  ORDER BY total_cost;
  ```
  
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Find all menu items for which more than 2 orders have been placed</summary>
    
  ```sql
  SELECT m.id AS menu_id,
         c.name AS cuisine_name,
         m.name AS menu_name
  FROM menu m 
  LEFT JOIN cuisines c ON m.cuisine_id = c.id
  WHERE m.id = ANY (SELECT menu_id FROM orders GROUP BY menu_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 2);
    ```
  
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Create a procedure that displays the maximum ordered quantity in the Orders table</summary>
    
  ```sql
  DELIMITER //
  
  CREATE PROCEDURE GetMaxQuantity()
  BEGIN
    SELECT MAX(quantity)
    FROM orders;
  END //
  
  DELIMITER ;
  ```
  
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Create a prepared statement to return the order id, the quantity and the order cost to some customer from the Orders table</summary>
    
  ```sql
  PREPARE GetOrderDetail FROM 'SELECT id, 
                                      quantity, 
                                      total_cost
                                      FROM orders
                                      WHERE customer_id = ?';
  
  SET @id = 1;
  EXECUTE GetOrderDetail USING @id;
  ```
  
  </details>
  <details>

  ```sql
  DELIMITER //
  
  CREATE PROCEDURE CancelOrder(IN order_id INT)
  BEGIN
    DELETE 
    FROM orders
    WHERE id = order_id;
    SELECT CONCAT("Order ",order_id, " is cancelled.") AS Confirmation;
